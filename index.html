        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Danson Kisilu" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My name is Danson Kisilu and I am from Nairobi, Kenya. I enjoy watching movies and going on road
            trips. <br>I'm a radiographer in Nairobi, Kenya and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in software
            engineering through the BYU Pathway program.
            <br>I'm a creative individual who is focused on the intersection of health care and technology, and so I
            continue to build my skills in Python and website development, with future interests in AI, machine
            learning, and cyber security.
            <br>The aspiration is to evolve into a health tech role, particularly in imaging informatics or PACS
            administration, where both my clinical experience and technical experience are of value in order to make a
            difference.
        </p>
